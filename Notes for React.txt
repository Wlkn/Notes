//MAKE YOUR APP//

To create an app with react, use the "npx create-react-app ${name}" command.
npm start - starts the development server
npm run build - for production build
npm test - for testing
ReactDOM.render - renders the app to the DOM but it is outdated and should be replaced with create root element and render it to the DOM.

Then remove the boilerplate code and only keep the App.js,index.js.

To return text with react, use the "return" keyword. To return multiple elements, wrap them in a div.
