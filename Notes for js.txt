let ** = x declares a variable.
You can change the variable, by using the name of the variable and change
what is after the equal sign.
const ** = x declares a constant.
What can let,and const hold: numbers, strings, and booleans.
Objects are written in this way:
let = {
    title: "Assasin's creed",
    author: "Leonardo da Vinci"
};
To create a class:
class Book {
    constructor(name,date,time) {
        this.name = name;
        this.date = date;
        this.time = time; 
    }    
}
and to make an object with it: let thisbook = new Book("Mohamed", "27", "12pm");
To make an array: You just store it using [  . . .  ]
let guests = ['Sarah Kate', 'Audrey Simon', 'Will Alexander'];

let firstGuest = guests[0]; // 'Sarah Kate'
let thirdGuest = guests[2]; // 'Will Alexander'
let undefinedGuest = guests[12]; // undefined
To add to an array: You use .push
To add to the beggining of an array: You use .unshift
To count the number of items in an array: You use .length
To remove the last item in an array: You use .pop
    &&   AND - checking if two conditions are both true.

    ||  OR — for checking if at least one condition is true.

    !  NOT — for checking if a condition is not true.
    
switches:

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    //Statements executed when the
    //result of expression matches value1
    [break;]
                //more values here
  [default:
    //Statements executed when none of
    //the values match the value of the expression
    [break;]]
}


    for to create loops
    :
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
    console.log(i);
    }
