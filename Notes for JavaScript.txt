Notes for JavaScript,
Goals:
How to structure and group information in your app with data types.

How to use programming logic so your app does what you want it to.

How to manage errors and make your app communicate.

How to write readable code so you can more easily modify, maintain, and share your apps.
----------------------------------------------------------------
 VARIABLES:

Try to use a descriptive name for your so instead of amount, or amt.use
quantityInStock or currentBalance.
To Declare a variable you do: "Let" 
let numberofepisodes = 6;
Now theses can be changed since it's not a constant
We could do :
let numbernumberofepisodes = 5;
numberofepisodes = 10
console.log(numbernumberofepisodes); it would say 10.
BUT if we do, const numbernumberofepisodes = 10; we can't change it since it becomes read only.
A type is the kind of data you store in it.
It can be divided in 6 categories, number,string,boolean,null,undefined and symbol.
Numbers: whole numbers are integers, while decimal numbers are called floating-point
Boolean: hold the value of true or false
Strings: string of characters that are enclosed in '' or "".
Strings can also be concatenated using the +.
let z = x + " " + y;
using the " " so the log isin't xy but rather x y.
Objects: They are written in JSON, serires of comma-separated value pairs which can store in a variable
let = {
    title: "title",
    author: "author",
};
Classes: They are templates for creating objects:
class Book {
    constructor(title: string, string2, number) {
        this.string = string;
        this.string2 = string2;
        this.number = number;
    }

}
let myBook = new Book("blabla", "yes", 242)

This is how you create an array, an array is a common type of collection, In JavaScript.
let guests = ['Sarah Kate', 'Audrey Simon', 'Will Alexander'];

let firstGuest = guests[0]; // 'Sarah Kate'
let thirdGuest = guests[2]; // 'Will Alexander'
let undefinedGuest = guests[12]; // undefined
    &&  — Logical AND — for checking if two conditions are both true.

    ||  — Logical OR — for checking if at least one condition is true.

    !  — Logical NOT — for checking if a condition is not true.
    switches 
The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses,
 and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, 
until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value.
A function is a block of code for  specific task.
A function needs 3 things:


A paramater, the argument, and the return value.

A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.
An argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function.
A return value is the value that a function returns to the code that called it.

 
Inserting JAVASCRIPT into HTML.
You can insert JavaScript into HTML by using the <script> tag.
DOM is the Document Object Model, it's a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
It represents the page so you can change the document structure, style and content.

document.getelementbytagname("p")[0].innerHTML = "Hello World"; 
(This will change the first paragraph to Hello World.)

document.getelementbyid("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World";
(This will change the element with the id of demo to Hello World.)

document.getelementbyclassname("intro")[0].innerHTML = "Hello World";(This will change the first element with the class of intro to Hello World.)  

document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (only the first one)
document.querySelectorAll("p").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (all of them)
document..querySelectorAll("p.intro").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (all of them with the class of intro)
document.querySelector("p#demo").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (the one with the id of demo)
document.querySelector("p.intro").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (the first one with the class of intro)
document.querySelector("p:first-child").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (the first one)
document.querySelector("p:last-child").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (the last one)
document.querySelector("p:nth-child(2)").innerHTML = "Hello World"; (the second one)

element.children[0].innerHTML = "Hello World"; (this will change the first child of the element)

element.parentElement.innerHTML = "Hello World"; (this will change the parent of the element)

element.nextElementSibling + previousElementSibling.innerHTML = "Hello World"; (this will change the next sibling of the element)

innerHTML is a property that represents the HTML content of an element.
Event listeners:
An event listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur.
An event is something that happens to the element you are waiting for, like a click, a mouseover, a keypress, etc.
The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
The event parameter is the type of event (like "click" or "mousedown").
The function parameter is the function to be executed when the event occurs.
The useCapture parameter is a Boolean value that specifies whether the event should be executed in the capturing or in the bubbling phase.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Request data from a backend.
A few things to know: 
http is the protocol that is used to transfer data on the web. (get and post, put and delete)
get is used to request data from a specified resource.
post is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
put is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
delete is used to delete the specified resource.
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. and it's a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.
Api stands for Application Programming Interface, it's a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, it's a lightweight data-interchange format.
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.

let apiRequest = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Create a request variable and assign a new XMLHttpRequest object to it.

apiRequest.open('GET', 'https://api-to-call.com/endpoint', true); // Open a new connection, using the GET request on the URL endpoint

apiRequest.send(); // Send request
apiRequest.onload = function() {
  // Begin accessing JSON data here
  let data = JSON.parse(this.response);
  // Do something with the data
}

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications.
With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
AJAX is not a programming language.
AJAX just uses a combination of:
A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
For example, asynchronous programming is a way to write code that does not wait for a response before moving on to the next line of code. Like ordering pizza and then going to the movies while you wait for the pizza to arrive.

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions, to be “called back” at a later time.
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
A callback function can run after another function has finished.
function doHomework(subject, callback) {
  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
  callback();
}
------------------------------------------------
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
A Promise is in one of these states:
pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
A Promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.
------------------------------------------------
Regex is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
There are multiple ways to use Regex:
Using the match() method: str.match(regexp)
Using the search() method: str.search(regexp)
Using the replace() method: str.replace(regexp)
Using the split() method: str.split(regexp)
Using the exec() method: regexp.exec(str)
Using the test() method: regexp.test(str)
To contain a regex in a string, you need to escape the special characters with a backslash.
Example: let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString);

/./

if (str.match(/regex/)) {
  // Do something
}
To do multiple searches with the same regex, you can use the pipe character |.
Example: let petString = "James has a pet cat.";
let petRegex = /dog|cat|bird|fish/;

To delimit a regex, you can use the caret ^ and dollar sign $. The caret matches the beginning of the string, and the dollar sign matches the end of the string.
Example: let firstString = "Ricky is first and can be found.";
let firstRegex = /^Ricky/;
let result = firstRegex.test(firstString);

let lastString = "You can't find Ricky now.";
let lastRegex = /Ricky$/;
let result = lastRegex.test(lastString);

Using the [ ] character set, you can search for a single character from a list of characters.

To search a range of characters, you can use the - character.

To exclude a character, you can use the ^ character.

You can also use the . character to match any character.

The ? character is used to match zero or one of the preceding element. It is also used to make a group optional. 
The * character is used to match zero or more of the preceding element.
The + character is used to match one or more of the preceding element.
The { } character is used to match a specific number of the preceding element.

Generic types: 
/d : finds a decimal digit
/w : finds a word character
/s : finds a whitespace character
/D : finds a non-digit character
/W : finds a non-word character
/S : finds a non-whitespace character
/./ : finds any character except for a newline

Meta characters:
^ : matches the beginning of input
$ : matches the end of input
\b : matches a word boundary
\B : matches a non-word boundary
\0 : matches a NULL character

If you need to search meta characters, you can use the \ character to escape them. \{}\

Build a regex:
For example let's check for an email address.
The email address should have a username, a @ symbol, a domain name, and a domain extension.
The username can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and periods.
The domain [...]

let email = "test@gmail.com";
let emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/;

emailRegex.test(email) ? console.log("Valid email address!") : console.log("Invalid email address!");

RegExp is a built-in object that provides functions for working with regular expressions.

let re = "test";
let myRegex = new RegExp("this is a " + re);

RegExp only posseds two methods: test() and exec().
The test() method searches a string for a match against a regular expression, and returns true or false.
The exec() method executes a search for a match in a specified string. Returns a result array, or null.

You can also use the RegExp.$1, RegExp.$2, ... RegExp.$9 properties to access the parenthesized substring matches.

let re = /(\w+)\s(\w+)/;
let str = "John Smith";
let newstr = str.replace(re, "$2, $1");
console.log(newstr);

To make a non-greedy match, you can use the ? character after the + or * character.

For example, let's say you want to match the string "hah" with the regex /ha{3,5}h/. Without the ? character, it would match the string "haaaah". With the ? character, it would match the string "hah".

let html = '<a href="www.my-adress.be"><strong class="web">My Website</strong></a>';

/<a href="(.+?)">/.exec(html);

console.log(RegExp.$1);

Search and replace :
let sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

let result = sentence.replace(/quick|brown|lazy/gi, function(match) {
  return match.toUpperCase();
});

console.log(result);

The g flag is used to find all matches instead of stopping after the first match.

let sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog barked, was it really lazy?";
let regex = /dog/g,"cat";
let result = sentence.replace(regex);
// this doesnt make any sense but oh well.

Search and capture:

let date = '05/27/2004';

date = date.replace(/^(\d{2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{4})$/, 'Le $2/$1/$3');

alert(date); // the 27/05/2004
