Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

To install Redux: 
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

To Create a react redux app:
# Redux + Plain JS template
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux

# Redux + TypeScript template
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript

To install Redux Core: 
npm install redux

The way to change the tree state is to dispatch an action. An action is a plain object describing what happened. Hereâ€™s an example action that adds a new todo item:

Create action -> dispatch action -> reducer -> update state -> render
